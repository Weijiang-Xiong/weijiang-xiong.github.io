      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 Open-Source Hardware and Programming, I organized a mechanical experiment as the TA lead.
This module consist of 5 electro-mechanical sub-modules, by assembling the mechanical parts and programming the stepper motor, the students can learn the basic steps of building a electro-mechanical system.
In this class, students need to assemble the mechanical parts of the module, and program an Arduino to control the motion of it.
Every five modules could be connected in a row to guide the motion of an wooden orb.
You can find the demonstration video &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X094g3h9elY&amp;amp;t=0s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PACE is an international collaborative competition.
We took part in the PACE 2018 Forum with excellent team mate from TU Darmstadt and Tu Turin.
In the PUMA project, our intelligent Portable Electrical Bicycle (PEB) aimed to improve the short-range transportation in urban life and I built the driving control module for it.
To further endow PEB with the ability to perceive the visual world, I embedded an object detector based on YOLO and Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supply Station</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Superpower Robot Team, I took the responsibility of the mechanical design of the supply station.
My team participated in RoboMaster 2017, a robot tactical combat competition, and we won the second prize in Eastern China Sector.
The supply station need to collect bullet balls from a &amp;ldquo;tube&amp;rdquo;, store them and distribute them to fellow robots.
It serves as the foundation of the whole match and means a lot.
Generally, it consist of 3 layers, which are collecting, storing and distributing layers from top to bottom.
The supply station is a flexible platform, which I designed intentionally in case of any changes.
It worked steadily during the competition in Eastern China Sector and efficiently supported the fight of my team.
And in the qualifying games for National Competition, the regulations on supply station had a little modification, the number of bullet balls provided each in each game had been significantly increased.
As a result, we could have enough bullets to load fellow robots several times!
I designed a more efficient and robust triggering facility to adapt to that change.
Besides, I reformed the collecting layer by adding a counting function, so that we could precisely distribute bullets to our fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
