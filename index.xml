      <title>Surrounding-Aware Correlation Filter for UAV Tracking with Selective Spatial Regularization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper corresponds to the research project I&amp;rsquo;ve done in Vision4Robotics Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual tracking means to estimate the trajectory of an arbitrary object in a video, given the bounding box of the object in the first frame.
I reviewed the development of the state-of-the-art algorithms, and was soon attracted by the elegant mathematical formula and superlative performance of &amp;ldquo;Correlation Filter-based methods&amp;rdquo;.
Although I quickly had a new idea, things did not go out smoothly as the framework I designed did not work at first.
Nevertheless, I dived deep into the formulas for an answer.
Through days of analysis, inside the matrices and vectors, I found an implicit incompatibility of two modules in my framework.
After solving it, rich experiments on UAV tracking videos demonstrated the good tracking ability of my framework.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 Open-Source Hardware and Programming, I organized a mechanical experiment as the TA lead.
This module consist of 5 electro-mechanical sub-modules.
In this class, students need to assemble the mechanical parts of the module, and program an Arduino to control the motion of it.
Every five modules could be connected in a row to guide the motion of an orb.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supply Station</title>
      <link>https://weijiang-xiong.github.io/project/supply-station/</link>

      <guid>https://weijiang-xiong.github.io/project/supply-station/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Superpower Robot Team, I took the responsibility of the mechanical design of the supply station.
My team participated in RoboMaster 2017, a robot tactical combat competition, and we won the second prize in Eastern China Sector.
The supply station need to collect bullet balls from a &amp;ldquo;tube&amp;rdquo;, store them and distribute them to fellow robots.
It serves as the foundation of the whole match and means a lot.
Generally, it consist of 3 layers, which are collecting, storing and distributing layers from top to bottom.
The supply station is a flexible platform, which I designed intentionally in case of any changes.
It worked steadily during the competition in Eastern China Sector and efficiently supported the fight of my team.
And in the qualifying games for National Competition, the regulations on supply station had a little modification, the number of bullet balls provided each in each game had been significantly increased.
As a result, we could have enough bullets to load fellow robots several times!
I designed a more efficient and robust triggering facility to adapt to that change.
Besides, I reformed the collecting layer by adding a counting function, so that we could precisely distribute bullets to our fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
