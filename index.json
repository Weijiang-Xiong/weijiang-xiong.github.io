With promising performance and efficiency, discriminative correlation filter-based trackers have drawn great attention and undergone remarkable progress. However, background interference and boundary effect remain two thorny problems. In this paper, a surrounding-aware tracker with selective spatial regularization (SASR) is presented. SASR tracker extracts surrounding samples according to the size and shape of the object in order to utilize context and maintain the integrality of the object. Additionally, a selective spatial regularizer is introduced to address boundary effect. Central coefficients in the filter are evenly regularized to preserve valid information from the object. While the others are penalized according to their spatial location. Under the framework of SASR tracker, surrounding information and selective spatial regularization prove to be complementary to each other, which actually did not draw much attention before. They managed to improve not only the robustness against various distractions in the surrounding but also the flexibility to catch up with frequent appearance change of the object. Qualitative evaluation and quantitative experiments on challenging UAV tracking sequences have shown that SASR tracker has performed favorably against 23 state-of-the-art trackers.","tags":[],"title":"Surrounding-Aware Correlation Filter for UAV Tracking with Selective Spatial Regularization","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In 2018 Open-Source Hardware and Programming, I organized a mechanical experiment as the TA lead.

But personally, I took the version of Fall 2011 I was quite moved by Prof. Strang\u0026rsquo;s devotion to teaching. In some lectures, there is no student in the classroom. And I learned from the comments that Prof. Strang re-recorded the video to improve something that he was not satisfied with.\n MIT 6.042 Mathematics for Computer Science\n This course talks about proof, tree, graph, counting and discrete probability. There is a free online text book on MIT OCW. It also talks about an example on random walk, which is quite similar to that in MIT 6.0002\n Highlights of Calculus\n Prof. Strang is really a devoted teacher!!!!! It is not a full course of calculus, I took it to review what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in my college courses.\n The Essence of Linear Algebra\n This course is offered by 3Blue1Brown. In this series, he used vivid animation to illustrates matrix and the corresponding spatial transform, which is really inspiring and intuitively understandable. I actually started from this and went on to MIT 18.06\n Programming Official Python Tutorial\n This is probably the best tutorial of python. It provides a comprehensive overview of python and explains how they works, which is often omitted by many textbooks. I read this along with the textbook of MIT 6.0001 \u0026amp; 6.0002\n MIT 6.0001 \u0026amp; 6.0002\n I like these wonderful series very much! They are really suitable for a novice who want to learn data science\u0026ndash;me, for example. Notably, Prof. Grimson and Dr. Anna wears the same clothes through out 6.0001 and 6.0002 ^_^.\n Robotics and AI In recent years, robotics and AI have gone through remarkable progress. Many new ideas are proposed almost every day, and learning it is impossible to keep abreast of the trend only by courses in the classroom. Therefore, I have spontaneously taken several online courses to know the latest development of these amazing subjects.\nCS229 Machine Learning\nCS231N Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition\nMIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning\nMIT 6.S094 Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars\nPyTorchZeroToAll\nOther Topics Kalman Filter\nLagrange Multiplers Khan Academy\n","date":1572955743,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572955743,"objectID":"d51f5a75b2b6d6236af3132cacd22419","permalink":"https://weijiang-xiong.github.io/post/ocw/","publishdate":"2019-11-05T20:09:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/ocw/","section":"post","summary":"There are a lot of academic institutes and individual researchers offering free online courses and learning materials to everyone.
